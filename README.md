# Password checker

The idea behind this script is to check your password against wordlists - locally.

You can run it on linux with command:
```
bash -c  "$(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Frostoriginal/PasswordCheck/refs/heads/main/pass.sh)"
```

or just clone this repo and run the script.
